# Usage in JavaScript

Written in ReScript isn't mean that only available for ReScript.

Packages are available for plain JavaScript & TypeScript projects.

## Pipe operator

ReScript is a functional language. Most of operations is provided through functions rather than objects or class.

You might need a pipe operator to compose operations.

```js
const pipe = (...fns) => (x) => fns.reduce((v, f) => f(v), x);
```

or in TypeScript project. You can use library like [pipe-ts](https://github.com/unsplash/pipe-ts)

## TypeScript

Packages provide TypeScript type definitions generated by [genType](https://rescript-lang.org/docs/gentype/latest/introduction)
