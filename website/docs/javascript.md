# Usage in JavaScript

Written in ReScript isn't necessarily mean that only available for ReScript.

Packages are available for plain JavaScript & TypeScript projects.

## Pipe operator

ReScript is a functional language. Most of operations is provided through functions rather than objects or class.

You might need a pipe operator to compose operations.

```js
const pipe = (...fns) => (x) => fns.reduce((v, f) => f(v), x);
```

or in TypeScript project. You can use library like [pipe-ts](https://github.com/unsplash/pipe-ts)

## Basic Usage

```js
import * as Vector from 'rescript-vector';

let vector1 = Vector.make();

let vector2 = pipe(
  v => Vector.push(v, 1),
  v => Vector.push(v, 2),
  v => Vector.push(v, 3),
)(vector1);

let result = Vector.toArray(vector2);

console.log(result);
// => [1, 2, 3]
```

## TypeScript

Packages provide TypeScript type definitions generated by [genType](https://rescript-lang.org/docs/gentype/latest/introduction)
